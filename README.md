# Build And Manage The Reproducible Pipeline With Apptainer As A Non-root User On HPC

This workshop introduces Apptainer, a powerful containerization tool designed for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Participants will learn how to build, manage, and deploy pipelines efficiently as non-root users, leveraging the flexibility and security of containerized workflows in resource-constrained environments. Topics will include container creation, pipeline integration, and best practices for seamless execution in HPC systems. For The Alliance HPC users, this workshop will demonstrate how to build Conda environment within an Apptainer container.
